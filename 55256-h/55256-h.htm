<p class="center"><small>TO MY PRESENT LITTLE MASTER, HARRY.</small><br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap"><small>My Dear Little Master</small></span>,</p>

<p><small>You have been kind to <i>me</i>, but you have spoken contemptuously of
donkeys in general. I want you to know better what sort of animals
donkeys really are, and so I have written for you this story of my life. You
will see, my dear little Master, that we donkeys have been, and still are,
often badly treated by human beings. We are often very nice indeed;
but I must also confess that in my youth I sometimes behaved very badly,
and you will see how I was punished for it, and how unhappy I was, and
how at last I repented, and how at last my repentance changed me and
gained for me the forgiveness of my friends and masters. So, when you
have read my history, you won’t say any more “as stupid as a donkey,”
or “as obstinate as a donkey,” but “as sensible as a donkey,” “as clever
as a donkey,” or “as gentle as a donkey.”</small></p>

<p><small>Hee-haw! my dear little Master, hee-haw! I hope you will never be
as <i>I</i> was when I was young.</small></p>

<p class="center"><small>I remain,</small></p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I do</span> not recollect my childhood; I was probably as
unhappy as the rest of the little donkeys are; and no
doubt as pretty and as graceful. Certainly I was full
of wit and intelligence, for, old as I am now, I have
more of both than most donkeys possess.</p>

<p>I have often outwitted some of my poor masters, who,
being only men, could not be expected to have the
intelligence of a donkey,—and I will begin my Memoirs
with the story of a trick I once played in the days of
my youth.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> author of this book was the daughter of that
Count Rostopchine who was governor of Moscow when
it was burned in 1812, and Napoleon was obliged in
consequence to make his disastrous retreat from that
city. Born in 1799, Sophie de Rostopchine married,
in 1821, the Count de Ségur, a son of one of the oldest
and proudest families of France. She was a very
accomplished and lovable person, and, as her writings
attest, she was thoroughly in sympathy with the ways
and feelings of children.</p>

<p>She did not begin to publish her stories until she was
fifty-seven years of age, but between that date and the
time of her death in 1874, she wrote and brought out a
great many books for children.</p>

<p>The “Memoirs of a Donkey,” published in 1860, is one
of the most popular, wholesome, and entertaining of
her books. It is longer in the original than the version
here given, as it contains a great number of scenes
that could interest only the boys and girls of France;
and there are many incidents in which the donkey
scarcely figures. We have, therefore, given in this
book the story of Neddy, the donkey. His adventures
are interesting and amusing enough by themselves, and
as there has been nothing quite like them originally
written in English, we have included this retelling of
the story in our Home and School Classics.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Men</span>, poor things, can’t be expected to be as
wise as donkeys, and therefore you probably
do not know that there was a market in our
country-town every Tuesday. At this market
vegetables were sold, and butter, and eggs, and
cheese, and fruit, and many other nice things.</p>

<p>Tuesday was a miserable day for the poor
donkeys, and especially for me. I belonged to
a farmer’s wife, and she was very severe and ill-tempered.
Just think! every week she used to
load up my back with all the eggs her hens laid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
all the butter and cheese she made from the
milk of her cows, all the vegetables and fruit
that were ready for market out of her garden.
Then she would get on the top of all this and
beat me with a hard, knotty stick because my
poor thin legs didn’t carry her to market with
all that load as fast as she liked. I trotted, I
almost galloped, but that farmer’s wife whipped
me all the same. I used to get very angry at
such cruelty and injustice. I tried to kick her
off, but I was loaded down too heavily, and so I
could only wobble about from side to side; but I
<i>did</i> have the satisfaction of knowing that she was
well jolted. Then she would growl, “Ah, you
wretched animal! see if I don’t teach you to
wobble!” and she would beat me again till I
could scarcely keep on my legs.</p>

<p>One day we reached the market-town in this
way, and the baskets with which my poor back
had been nearly crushed were taken off and set
down upon the ground. My mistress hitched
me to a post, and went away to get her dinner.
I was dying of hunger and thirst, but nobody
thought of offering <i>me</i> a single blade of grass
or a drop of water. While the farmer’s wife was
away, I managed to get my head close to the
basket of vegetables, and made a dinner of the
cabbages and lettuces. I never tasted anything
so good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p>I had just finished the last cabbage and the
last lettuce in that basket when my mistress
came back. She cried out when she saw the
empty basket, and I looked at her with such an
impudent and self-satisfied air, that she at once
guessed that <i>I</i> was the culprit. I won’t repeat to
you the mean things she said to me. When she
was angry she used language which was enough
to make me blush, donkey as I am. So after
heaping me with abuse, of which I took no
notice, she seized her stick and began to beat
me so severely, that at last I lost patience and
launched out three kicks. The first kick broke
her nose and two teeth, the second sprained her
wrist, and the third knocked her flat.</p>

<p>A score of people at once set upon me and
knocked me about. They picked up my mistress
and carried her away, leaving me fastened
to the post, by the side of which were spread out
the things I had brought to be sold in the market.
I remained there a long while, and finding
that no one paid any more attention to me, I ate
a second basketful of excellent vegetables, and
then with my teeth I gnawed through the cord
that tied me up, and quietly took the road home.</p>

<p>The people I passed on the way were astonished
to see me all alone.</p>

<p>“Look,” said one, “see that ass with the
broken nose! He has run away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>“Then he has run away from prison,” said the
other, and they all began to laugh.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t carry a heavy load upon his
back,” said a third.</p>

<p>“Certainly he has done some mischief,” a
fourth one said.</p>

<p>“Catch him and we will put the little one
upon his back,” said a woman.</p>

<p>“He will carry you as well as the little boy,”
answered her husband.</p>

<p>I, wishing to give a good opinion of my kindness
and good will, came gently towards the
country woman and stopped near her to let her
mount upon my back.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t seem a bad sort!” said the man,
helping his wife to the saddle.</p>

<p>I smiled with pity on hearing this remark.
Bad! as if a donkey kindly treated were ever
bad! We become angry, disobedient, and obstinate
only to revenge ourselves for the blows and
injuries we receive. When we are well treated
we are good,—much better, in fact, than many
other animals.</p>

<p>I took the young woman and her little child of
two years back to their home; they stroked me,
were very much pleased with me, and would willingly
have kept me.</p>

<p>But it was, I thought, not honest to stay with
them. My masters had bought me and I be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>longed
to them. I had already broken my mistress’s
nose, teeth, and wrist, and had kicked her
in the stomach. I was sufficiently revenged.</p>

<div class="caption">“<span class="smcap">I jumped clean over the Hedge.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Seeing that the mother was going to give in
to her little boy (who I noticed was a spoiled
child), I jumped to one side, and before the
mother could catch my bridle again, I ran away
at a gallop and came back to my home.</p>

<p>Mary, my mistress’s little girl, saw me come
back.</p>

<p>“Hallo, here’s Neddy,” she said; “how early
he is! Jim, come and take off his pack-saddle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>“That wretched donkey!” growled Jim; “always
something to be done for him! Why is he
alone? I suspect he has run away from mother.”</p>

<p>My saddle and bridle were taken off, and I galloped
away to the meadow. Suddenly I heard
shrieks. I looked over the hedge, and saw some
men carrying my mistress home. Then I heard
Jim say:—</p>

<p>“I say, father, I’m going to take the cart-whip,
and I shall tie that donkey to a tree, and then
whip him till he can’t stand.”</p>

<p>“All right, my lad,” said my master, “but mind
and don’t kill him, for he cost money. I’ll sell
him next fair-day.”</p>

<p>I shuddered when I heard this. There wasn’t
a moment to be lost. This time I did not care
whether they lost their money or not. I made a
run and jumped clean over the hedge. Then I
ran till I was out of sight and hearing in the
depths of a beautiful large forest, where there
was plenty of soft grass to eat, and plenty of
sparkling brooks to drink from.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day after, I thought over my good fortune.
“Here I am saved,” thought I; “they never will
find me, and in a couple of days, when I am quite
rested, I will go farther on.”</p>

<p>Just then I heard the far-off barking of a dog;
then of a second one; and several minutes afterwards
the yelling of a whole pack. Restless and
frightened, I got up and went towards a little
brook that I had noticed in the morning. I had
hardly ventured into the water, when I heard Jules
saying to the dogs, “Go on, go on, dogs, search
him out, find this miserable donkey, and bring
him back to me.”</p>

<p>I nearly fell down with fright, but I quickly
remembered that if I walked in the water the
dogs could not follow my scent. So I began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
run in the brook which was fortunately bordered
on both sides with thick bushes.</p>

<p>I went on for a long time without stopping.
The barking of the dogs as well as the voice of
Jules became fainter, until at last I heard nothing
more.</p>

<p>Breathless and exhausted I rested a minute to
drink. I ate a few leaves off the bushes. My
legs were stiff with cold, but I did not dare to
get out of the water lest the dogs might come
upon my scent again. When I had rested a
little, I set off again, always following the brook
until I got out of the forest. I then found myself
in a meadow where over fifty cattle were
grazing. I lay down in the sun in a corner of
the field. The cattle paid no attention to me, so
that I could rest at my ease.</p>

<p>Towards evening two men came into the
meadow. “Brother,” said the taller of the two,
“shall we take the cattle in to-night? They say
there are wolves in the woods.”</p>

<p>“Wolves! Who told you that nonsense?”</p>

<p>“People say that the donkey from the farm has
been taken away and eaten in the forest.”</p>

<p>“Bah! don’t believe it; the people of that farm
are so wicked that they have killed their donkey
with bad treatment.”</p>

<p>“Then why do they say that the wolves have
eaten him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>“So that people won’t know that they have
killed him.”</p>

<p>“We had better take in our cattle, all the same.”</p>

<p>“Do as you wish, brother; it is all one to me.”</p>

<p>I was in such fear of being seen that I lay in
my corner and did not stir; fortunately the grass
was long and hid me; the cattle were not on the
side where I was. The men drove them towards
the gate, and then to the farm where their masters
lived.</p>

<p>I was not afraid of wolves, because the donkey
of whom they spoke was myself, and because I
had not seen the tail of a wolf in the forest where
I passed the night. So I slept beautifully and
was finishing my breakfast when the cattle came
back to the meadow, guarded by two large
dogs.</p>

<p>I was looking at them, when one of the dogs
saw me, and, barking fiercely, ran towards me, his
companion following. What should I do? how
could I escape them?</p>

<p>I flew towards the hedges surrounding the
meadow, through which ran the brook I had
followed. I was fortunate enough to jump over
it, and I heard the voice of one of the men I had
seen yesterday, calling off his dogs.</p>

<p>I went on my way at my ease, and walked as
far as another forest, the name of which I don’t
know. I must have gone more than ten miles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
I was saved; nobody knew me; and I could show
myself without fear of being taken back to my
former masters.</p>

<p>But it began to grow cold, for winter was coming
on, and I thought it high time to look out for
a comfortable home. I trotted on right through
the forest, and out at the other side, and after
some days’ travelling, I arrived at a village that
I had never seen or heard of before. Here I felt
I should be safe.</p>

<p>Just outside the village there stood a little cottage
in a garden quite by itself. It was very
clean and neat. An old woman was sitting by
the door doing some needlework. I thought she
looked both kind and sad; so I went up to her,
and put my head on her shoulder.</p>

<p>The good woman gave a shriek, and jumped
up quickly.</p>

<p>I did not move, but lifted my face towards hers
with a gentle and pleading look.</p>

<p>“Poor thing!” she said at last; “you don’t look
like a bad creature. If you don’t belong to any
one, you shall take the place of my poor Greycoat,
who died the other day of old age, and I shall still
be able to earn my living by taking my vegetables
to market to sell. But,” she added, with a
sigh, “you’ve got a master somewhere, I’ll be
bound.”</p>

<p>“Granny, whom are you talking to?” said a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
pleasant voice from the house, and a nice little
boy came out of the door. He was six or
seven years old, poorly but very neatly dressed.
He looked at me, half admiring, half afraid.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_p11.jpg" width="500" height="621" alt="I galloped along." />
<div class="caption">“I galloped along.” P. <a href="#Page_12">12.</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>“Granny, may I stroke him?” he said.</p>

<p>“Of course you may, George, my dear; but
take care he doesn’t bite you.”</p>

<p>The little boy stretched up his hand, but he
was so short that he had to stand on tiptoe
before he could reach my back. I didn’t move,
for fear of frightening him; I only turned my
head round, and licked his hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, granny, granny! just see! what a dear
donkey! he licked my hand!”</p>

<p>“It’s very strange,” said George’s grandmother,
“that he should be here all by himself. Go to
the village, my dear, and ask whether anybody
has lost a donkey. Perhaps his master is very
anxious about him.”</p>

<p>George set off at a run, and I trotted after him.
When he saw me come up, and then stand still
by a mound on the roadside, he climbed up on
my back, and said, “<i>Gee up!</i>”</p>

<p>I galloped along, and George was enchanted.
When we got to the village inn, George cried,
“<i>Whoa back!</i>” and I stopped immediately.</p>

<p>“What do you want, laddie?” said the innkeeper.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, do you know whose donkey this
is?”</p>

<p>The innkeeper came out, and looked me all over.
“No, my boy, he isn’t mine, and he doesn’t belong
to any one I know. Go and ask farther on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>So George went through the village asking the
same question, but nobody had ever seen me
before. At last we went back to the good old
woman, who was still sitting with her work at
the cottage door.</p>

<p>“So you can’t find his master, my dear? Very
well, then, we may keep him till he is claimed.
He mustn’t stay out all night. Take him to
Greycoat’s shed, and give him some hay and a
pail of water.”</p>

<p>The next morning George came to fetch me
out of the shed, and gave me some breakfast.
Then he put on the halter, and took me round to
the cottage door. The old woman put a light
pack-saddle on my back and mounted. Then
George brought her a basket of vegetables, which
she took on her knee, and we set off to market.
Nobody in this market-town had ever seen or
heard of me, and I came back joyfully to my new
home.</p>

<p>I lived there for four years, and was very happy.
I did my work well and never did anybody any
harm. I loved my good old mistress and my
little master. They never beat me or overworked
me, and they gave me the best food they could.
We donkeys are not dainty. The outside leaves
of vegetables and plants that cows and horses
won’t eat, and hay and potato-peel and carrots
and turnips, are all we need.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> some days, however, I was not so happy,
for my mistress, now and then, hired me out to
the children in the neighborhood. She was not
well off, and on the days when she had nothing
for me to do she was glad to earn something in
this way.</p>

<p>And the people who hired me were not always
good to me, as the following story will show:—</p>

<p>There were six donkeys in a row in the courtyard;
I was the strongest and one of the most
beautiful. Three little girls brought us oats in
a bucket; as I ate I listened to the children
talking.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i>—Come along, let us choose our donkeys.
I’ll begin by taking this one (pointing me
out with his finger).</p>

<p>“Yes, you always take what you think is the
best,” said the six children all at once. “We must
draw lots.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p><i>Charles.</i>—How can we draw lots, Caroline?
Can we put the donkeys in a bag and draw them
out like marbles?</p>

<p><i>Anthony.</i>—Ha! ha! ha! The idea of donkeys
in a bag! As if one could not number them
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Put the numbers in a bag and
draw them out as they come.</p>

<p>“That is so, that is so,” cried the five others.
“Ernest, make the number slips while we write
them on the backs of the donkeys.”</p>

<p>“These children are stupid,” said I to myself;
“if they had the sense of a donkey, instead of giving
themselves the trouble of writing the numbers on
our backs, they would simply place us along the
wall; then the first would be 1, the second 2, and
so on.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Anthony had brought a large piece
of charcoal. I was the first. He wrote a large 1
on my flank; while he was writing 2 on that of
my comrade, I shook myself to show him that
his invention was not very clever. In a moment
the 1 had disappeared. “Stupid,” cried he, “I
must begin again.”</p>

<p>While he was doing his number 1 over again,
my comrade, who had seen me, and who was
clever, shook himself in his turn. There was the
2 gone. Then Anthony began to get angry, and
the others laughed and teased him. I made a
sign to my comrades to let them go on, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
not one of us moved after being marked. Ernest
returned with the numbers in his pocket-handkerchief.
Each one drew.</p>

<p>While they were looking at their numbers, I
made another sign to my comrades, and we all
shook ourselves vigorously. Charcoal and numbers
disappeared and all must be done over again!
The children were angry; Charles was triumphant
and sneering; Ernest, Albert, Caroline, Cecil and
Louise, crying out against Anthony, who stamped
his feet. They began to quarrel with each other,
and my comrades and I began to bray.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_p16.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="We were placed along the Wall." />
<div class="caption">"We were placed along the Wall."</div>
</div>

<p>The noise brought out the fathers and the
mothers, to whom the matter was explained. One
of the fathers at last thought of placing us in
order along the wall. Then they made the children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
draw the numbers. “One!” cried Ernest.
It was I. “Two!” said Cecil. It was one of my
friends. “Three!” said Anthony, and so on
until the last donkey was drawn. “Now, let us
go,” said Charles; “I will start first.” “Oh!
I shall catch up with you,” quickly answered
Ernest. “I’ll wager you won’t,” said Charles.
“I’ll wager I will,” replied Ernest. Charles struck
his donkey and started at a gallop. Before
Ernest had time to strike me with his whip, I
started also, and at a rate which enabled us soon
to overtake Charles and his donkey.</p>

<p>Ernest was delighted; Charles was furious and
beat his donkey repeatedly. Ernest had no need
to beat me; I ran like the wind, and passed
Charles in a minute. I heard the others following,
laughing and shouting.</p>

<p>“Bravo! donkey Number 1! He runs like a
horse.” Pride gave me courage. I continued to
gallop until we reached a bridge, where I stopped
suddenly, for I saw that one of the large boards
of the bridge was rotten. I did not wish to fall
into the water with Ernest, so I decided to return
to the others, who were far, far behind us.</p>

<p>“Gee up! Gee up! Donkey!” said Ernest,
“over the bridge, my friend, over the bridge.” I
would not go on; he hit me with his stick, but
I continued to walk towards the others. “Obstinate,
stupid brute! will you turn round and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
cross the bridge?” said he. I walked on towards
my comrades, and joined them in spite of the
insults and blows of this wicked boy.</p>

<p>“Why do you beat your donkey, Ernest?” cried
Caroline; “he is very good; he took you like lightning,
and made you pass Charles.” “I beat him
because he would not cross the bridge,” said
Ernest; “he took it into his head to turn back.”
“Nonsense! that was because he was alone; now
that we are all together, he will cross the bridge
like the others.”</p>

<p>“Unhappy children,” thought I, “they all will
tumble into the river. I must try to show them
that there is danger;”—and again I started at a
gallop, running towards the bridge, to the great
satisfaction of Ernest and the other children,
who shouted with joy. I galloped to the bridge,
but as soon as I got there, I stopped suddenly
as if I were afraid. Ernest was astonished, and
urged me to go on. I drew back with a frightened
look which still more surprised Ernest.
The silly fellow saw nothing: the rotten board
was, nevertheless, in plain sight. Presently the
others rejoined us and looked on laughingly at
Ernest’s attempts to make me cross. Then they
got off their donkeys and each one pushed me
and beat me without pity. But I did not stir.</p>

<p>“Pull him by his tail,” cried Charles; “donkeys
are so stubborn, that when you want them to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
backwards they go forwards.” Then they tried
to catch hold of my tail.</p>

<p>I defended myself by kicking, upon which they
all beat me at once, but in spite of this I would
not move.</p>

<p>“Wait, Ernest,” said Charles, “I will go over
first; your donkey will certainly follow me.”</p>

<p>He started to go on; I put myself across the
entrance to the bridge. He made me turn by
dint of blows.</p>

<p>“All right,” said I, “if this naughty boy wishes
to drown himself, let him. I did what I could to
save him; let him drown if he wishes so much to
do so.”</p>

<p>No sooner had his donkey put his foot upon
the rotten board than it broke, and there was
Charles and his donkey in the water!</p>

<p>There was no danger for my comrade, because,
like all donkeys, he could swim.</p>

<p>Charles struggled in frantic attempts to get
out. “A stick! a stick!” he cried. The children
screamed and ran here and there. At last Caroline
found a long stick, picked it up and gave it
to Charles, who seized it; but his weight dragged
down Caroline, who called out for help.</p>

<p>Ernest, Anthony, and Albert ran to her. At
last the unhappy Charles, who had by this time
got more than he bargained for, was pulled out
of the water soaked from head to foot. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
he was safe the children began to laugh at his
doleful appearance. Charles growing angry, the
children jumped upon their donkeys and advised
him to return to his home to change his clothes.
Dripping wet he remounted his donkey. I
laughed to myself at his ridiculous appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_p20.jpg" width="400" height="258" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The current had swept away his hat and his
shoes; the water ran in streams from his clothes;
his soaked, wet hair stuck to his face, and his furious
look made him a thoroughly comical sight.
The children laughed; my comrades jumped and
ran to express their joy. I must add that Charles’s
donkey was detested by all of us, because, unlike
most donkeys, he was quarrelsome, greedy, and
stupid.</p>

<p>At last, Charles having disappeared, the children
and my comrades were calmed down. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
one stroked me and admired my cleverness. We
all set out again, I at the head of the party.</p>

<p>But these lively times were coming to an end.
One day, George’s father, who was a soldier, came
home from the army and bought a house in town.
His mother and his little boy went to live with
him, and I was sold to a neighboring farmer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> new master was not a bad sort of man,
but he had what I thought was an unpleasant
habit of making everybody work very hard. He
used to harness me to a little cart, and make me
carry earth and apples and wood and many other
things. I began to grow lazy; I didn’t enjoy
going in harness, and I disliked market-days very
much. It wasn’t that they made me draw too
heavy a load or that they beat me, but I had to go
without anything to eat from morning till three or
four o’clock in the afternoon. When the weather
was hot I nearly died of thirst, and yet I had to
wait till everything was sold, and my master had
got all his money.</p>

<p>I wasn’t always good in those days. I wanted
them to treat me kindly, and as they didn’t, I began
to think of revenge. You see that donkeys
are not always stupid, but you also see that I was
growing bad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>On market-days in the summer the people at
the farm always got up very early to cut the
vegetables and gather the eggs and churn the
butter, while I was still lying out in the meadow.
I used to watch all this going on, knowing that
at eight o’clock they would come and fetch me
to be harnessed to the cart.</p>

<p>One day I determined to play them a trick.</p>

<p>In the meadow I had noticed a deep ditch filled
with thistles and blackberry bushes. “Now,” I
said to myself, “I’ll hide in that ditch, so that
when they come to fetch me there’ll be no donkey
anywhere to be seen.” So, as soon as I saw the
cart being filled and the people bustling about,
I ran off to the side of the field, and lay down
very softly in the ditch, so that I was quite hidden
by the bushes.</p>

<p>In a little while I heard one of the farm boys
call me, and then run looking about for me
everywhere, and at last go back to the farm. In
a few minutes I heard the farmer himself say,
“He must have got through the hedge. But
where <i>could</i> he have broken through? There
doesn’t seem to be a hole anywhere. Oh, I
know! some one must have left the gate open.
Who was it? Here, boys, run out and look in
the fields over yonder! He can’t be far off.
And make haste, for it’s getting late.”</p>

<p>So all the farm help turned out to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
for me. It was broiling weather, and after a
while the poor people came back very hot, very
limp, and panting for breath. The farmer declared
that I must have been stolen, and that I
was a great donkey to let any one steal me, and
so on. Then he harnessed one of the horses to
the cart, and drove off late to market, in a very
bad temper.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_p24.jpg" width="500" height="343" alt="I galloped to the Other End of the Meadow." />
<div class="caption">"I galloped to the Other End of the Meadow.”</div>
</div>

<p>When I saw that all was quiet again, and
that nobody was looking, I scrambled out of my
ditch, and galloped off to the other end of the
meadow, so that they shouldn’t suspect where I’d
been. Then I opened my mouth, and began to
<i>hee-haw! hee-haw!</i> with all my might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>At this noise, all the people at the farm rushed
out.</p>

<p>“Hello! why, there he is!” said the shepherd.</p>

<p>“Where has he been all this while?” said the
mistress.</p>

<p>“How did he get in again?” said the carter.</p>

<p>I was so delighted not to go to market, that
I went prancing up to them. They were very
glad to see me; they patted me, and said I was
a good, clever donkey to have managed to escape
from the thieves who had stolen me, till I felt
quite ashamed of myself, for I knew that I didn’t
deserve all this, and that I did deserve the stick.
Then they left me to graze all day in the meadow,
and I should have enjoyed myself very much,
if my conscience hadn’t given me such a bad
time of it.</p>

<p>The farmer was very much surprised to see me
when he came home. The next day he went all
round the meadow, and carefully stopped up
every hole he could find in the hedge, until there
wasn’t room for a cat to get through.</p>

<p>The week passed quietly away until market-day
came again, and then I hid myself in the
ditch as before. The people at the farm could
not make it out, and thought that the thieves
who stole me were unusually clever.</p>

<p>“This time,” said the farmer, “he must be
really lost and gone for good,” and he harnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
one of the horses and went off to market as before.
When everything was quiet I came out
again, but this time I thought I had better not
say “<i>hee-haw!</i>” to let them know I was there.
When at last they found me, they didn’t stroke
or pat me, and they said so little that I thought
they must suspect something. But I didn’t care,
and I said to myself,—</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, my good friends, you’ll think yourselves
very clever if you find me out, but I don’t
intend you shall,” and so when market-day came
round, I made for my ditch for the third time.</p>

<p>But scarcely was I safely hidden among the
thistles and blackberry bushes, when I heard
the big watch-dog bark, and then the voice of
the farmer say,—</p>

<p>“Here, Rover, Rover, good dog, then! go and
look for him!” and in a moment Rover had
pounced upon my hiding-place, and was growling
and snapping at my heels in a most unpleasant
manner. I made for the hedge, and tried to
force a way through, but in vain.</p>

<p>“Good dog, good Rover, good dog!” shouted
the farmer, and he threw a lasso at me, which
caught me and stopped me short. Then he led
me back and tied me up, and I heard that one of
the farmer’s little boys had been watching the
meadow from a place where I couldn’t see him,
and that he had told where I was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">"I drank up a Bowl of Cream."</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>After that I was much more severely treated.
They shut me up, but I learned how to draw
bolts and lift up latches with my teeth, and so
get out. All day long you might have heard
the people of the farm saying, “<i>Oh!</i> there’s
that donkey <i>again</i>!” The farmer grumbled and
beat me, but I became worse and worse. I compared
my wretched life now with the happy one
I had led in former days under the same master,
and instead of trying to leave off behaving badly,
I became more and more naughty and obstinate
every day. One day I went into the kitchen
garden and ate up all the lettuce; another day
I knocked down the little boy who had told tales
about me; another day I drank up a bowl of
cream that had been set outside the door ready
for churning. I trod on the fowls, and bit the
pigs, till at last the mistress said she couldn’t
stand it any longer, and she begged her husband
to sell me at the next fair.</p>

<p>So, when the fair-day came, my master took
me away.</p>

<p>He sold me to a family where there was a little
invalid girl whom I had to take out; but I didn’t
stay there long, for the little girl died, and then
her parents, who had never liked me, turned me
adrift to go where I pleased, and to live as best I
could.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the next winter I had no one to take care
of me. I had to live in the forest, where I found
scarcely enough to keep me from dying of hunger
and thirst. I had plenty of time to think how
wicked I’d been; how happy I was until I had
given myself over to laziness, and spitefulness,
and revenge; and to make up my mind to turn
over a new leaf if ever I got the chance.</p>

<p>When the spring came, I went one day to a
village on the edge of the forest, and was surprised
to find quite a commotion there. The
people were walking up and down; everybody
had on his Sunday clothes; and, what was
stranger still, all the donkeys in the neighborhood
seemed to be there. They were sleek and
fat, their heads were decorated with flowers and
leaves, and not one of them was in harness or
had a rider.</p>

<p>I trotted up to see if I could find out what
all this was about, when suddenly one of the boys
who were standing there saw me, and shouted,—</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, look here! here’s a fine donkey!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>“My word!” said another, “how well groomed
he is! and how fat and well fed!” and they
roared with laughter.</p>

<p>“I suppose he’s come to run in the donkey
race,” said a third, “but <i>he</i> won’t win the prize!
No fear!”</p>

<p>I was very much annoyed at these rude jokes
and personal remarks; but I thought I should
enjoy taking part in the race, so I listened
again.</p>

<p>“Where are they going to run?” asked an old
dame, who had just come up.</p>

<p>“In the meadow by the mill,” said a man
named Andrew.</p>

<p>“How many donkeys are there?” asked the
old woman.</p>

<p>“Sixteen, Mother Evans, and the one that
comes in first will win a silver watch and a bag
of money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, deary me!” said Mother Evans, “I do
wish <i>I</i> had a donkey. I <i>should</i> so like to have
a watch. I’ve never had the money to buy
one.”</p>

<p>I liked the look of this old woman; I was
justly proud of my running; I had been so long
in the forest that I was not too fat, as some of
these prize donkeys were; and so I <i>would</i> take
part in the race. I trotted up to the others,
and took my place among them, and then, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
attract attention, I opened my mouth and brayed
vigorously.</p>

<p>“Oh, you stop that!” cried out a man named
Bill. “Hi! you there, donkey, you just stop that
music, will you? and get out of there! <i>You</i>
can’t run, you shabby brute! and, besides, you
don’t belong to anybody.”</p>

<p>I held my tongue, but I didn’t budge an inch.
Some laughed, and others were getting angry,
when old Mother Evans said:—</p>

<p>“Well, he can have <i>me</i> for his mistress. I take
him into my service from this minute. So now
he can run for me.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bill, “do as you like, mother.
Only if you want him to run, you’ve got to put
a quarter into the bag the Squire has yonder.”</p>

<p>“All right, my dear,” said Mother Evans, and
she hobbled off to where the Squire was sitting
and paid her subscription into the bag.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said the Squire; “put Mrs.
Evans’s name down, Richard.”</p>

<p>So the clerk put down my new mistress’s name.
We were all drawn up in a line in the meadow.
The Squire said, “One, two, three, and away!” the
boys who held the donkeys let them go, and
away we galloped as hard as we could, while the
crowd ran cheering alongside.</p>

<p>The sixteen donkeys had not gone a hundred
yards before I was in front of them all, an easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
first. I thought I <i>would</i> beat them all now, at
any rate, and I flew along as if I had wings.
I passed proudly before the winning-post, not
only first, but a long way ahead of all the rest,
amid loud cheers from those who had no donkeys
in the race.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_p33.jpg" width="500" height="316" alt="I was ahead of All." />
<div class="caption">"I was ahead of All."</div>
</div>

<p>The Squire sat at a table to give away the
prizes, and Mother Evans, who was almost
beside herself with delight, stroked and patted
me, and led me up to the table with her to
receive the first prize.</p>

<p>“Here, my good woman,” said the Squire; and
he was just going to hand the watch and the bag
of money to the old woman.</p>

<p>“Please, your worship, it isn’t fair!” cried Bill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
and Andrew. “It isn’t fair! That donkey
doesn’t really belong to Mother Evans any
more than it does to us! <i>Our</i> donkeys really
got in first, not counting this one. The watch
and money ought to be ours. It isn’t fair!”</p>

<p>“Did Mrs. Evans pay her quarter into the
bag?” said the Squire.</p>

<p>“Well, your worship, she did, but—”</p>

<p>“Did any of you object to her doing so at the
time?” asked the Squire.</p>

<p>“Well, no, your worship, but—”</p>

<p>“Did you raise any objection when the donkeys
were just going to start?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, sir, but—”</p>

<p>“Very well, then. It’s all perfectly fair, and
Mrs. Evans gets the watch and bag of money.”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, it isn’t fair, it isn’t fair! You—”</p>

<p>When I heard this, I at once put my head
down on the table, and taking up the watch and
bag in my teeth, put them into Mother Evans’s
hands. This intelligent action on my part made
the people roar with laughter, and won for me
thunders of applause.</p>

<p>“There!” said the Squire, “the donkey has
decided in favor of Mother Evans; and,” he
added, with a smile, looking at Bill and Andrew,
“I don’t think <i>he</i> is the biggest donkey present!”</p>

<p>“Bravo, your worship!” “Good for you!” resounded
on all sides. And every one began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
laugh at Andrew and Bill, who went away looking
cross and ill-tempered.</p>

<p>And was <i>I</i> pleased? No, not at all. My
pride was hurt. The Squire had been very rude
to me; he had actually put men, these stupid
men, on a level with an intelligent and right-minded
donkey like myself! It was too much!
I declined to stay in a place where I was so
insulted, and I turned tail and trotted away from
such an ignorant set of people.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Presently</span> I stopped. I was in a meadow.
I felt tired and sad. I was just asking myself
whether donkeys were not a great deal better
than human beings, when a soft little hand
touched me, and a soft little voice said:—</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>poor</i> donkey! How thin you are! Perhaps
you’ve been badly treated. Come home
and see my grandma! <i>She’ll</i> take good care of
you.”</p>

<p>I looked round. There stood a nice little boy
about five years old; his little sister, who was only
three, was running by the side of their nurse.</p>

<p>“What’s that you’re saying, Master Jack?”
said the nurse.</p>

<p>“Oh, nursie, I am telling him to come home
with us to see grandma.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” cried the little girl, whose name
was Janie; “and let me ride on his back. Nurse,
up, up!”</p>

<p>The nurse put the little girl on my back, and
Jack wanted to lead me, but of course I had no
bridle on, so he came up and stroked me softly
and whispered in my ear:—</p>

<p>“Gee up, Neddy! Come along, dear Neddy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_p37.jpg" width="500" height="684" alt="I followed him All the Way." />
<div class="caption">"I followed him All the Way."</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>I was so pleased with this little boy’s trusting
me, that I at once followed him all the way, occasionally
touching his hand with my nose.</p>

<p>“Oh, nurse, nurse—look! He’s kissing me!”
cried Jack.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my dear!” said the nurse. “He
does that because he smells the piece of bread
you have in your pocket.”</p>

<p>I was so hurt at this unkind remark from the
nurse, that I turned my head away all the rest
of the time we were going to the house of the
children’s grandmamma.</p>

<p>When we got there they left me at the door
and ran in, and in a few minutes they returned
with a kind-looking, pretty old lady with white
hair.</p>

<p>“Look, grandma, isn’t he a dear donkey?”
said Jack, clasping his hands. “And oh, grandma,
may we keep him?”</p>

<p>“Let me see him closer, my dears,” said the
old lady, and she came down and patted me, and
felt my ears and put her hand into my mouth. I
stood perfectly still, and was very careful not to
bite her, even by mistake.</p>

<p>“Well, he <i>does</i> look gentle, my dears,” said
the old lady. “Emily,” she added, to the nurse,
“tell the coachman to make inquiries to find
out to whom he belongs, and if he is not reclaimed,
we will keep him, at any rate for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
present. Poor creature, how thin and neglected
he looks! Jack, go and call Robert; I shall have
him put in the stable, with something to eat and
drink.”</p>

<p>The stableman came and led me away, and
Jack and Janie followed. I had two horses
and another donkey for companions in the
stable. Robert made me a nice litter of straw
to sleep on, and then fetched me a measure
of oats.</p>

<p>“Oh, Robert, give him more than that!” cried
Jack, “it’s such a little, and Emily says he ran in
the village race. He must be <i>so</i> tired and hungry.
More, more!”</p>

<p>“But, Master Jack,” said Robert, “if you give
him too many oats he will be too lively, and then
neither you nor Miss Janie will be able to ride
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is such a kind donkey, I’m sure he
will go quietly for us. Do, Robert, do <i>please</i>
give him some more!”</p>

<p>So Robert gave me another measure of oats,
a large pail of water, and some hay. I made
an enormous supper, and then lay down on my
straw, and slept like a king.</p>

<p>The next day I had nothing to do but to take
the children for an hour’s ride. Jack brought
me my oats himself, and, paying no heed to
what Robert said, he gave me enough for three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
donkeys of my size. I ate it all up, and was
delighted at having so many good things.</p>

<p>But on the third day I felt very ill. My head
ached. I had indigestion. I was very feverish.
I could eat neither oats nor hay. I couldn’t
even get up, and was still lying stretched on
my straw when Jack came to see me.</p>

<p>“Why, Neddy is still in bed!” cried Jack.
“Get up, Neddy, it is breakfast time. I’ll give
you your oats.”</p>

<p>I tried to lift up my head, but it fell heavily
back on the straw.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s ill, Neddy’s ill!” cried Jack, in a great
fright. “Robert, quick, quick! Neddy’s very ill!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” said Robert, coming in
at the stable door. “I filled his manger early
this morning. Ah,” he added, looking at the
hay in the manger, which was quite untouched,
“there must be something wrong.”</p>

<p>He felt my ears; they were very hot, and my
sides were throbbing. He looked serious.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it? what is it?” cried poor
Jack, almost in tears.</p>

<p>“He’s got the fever, Master Jack, from overeating.
I told you how it would be if you <i>would</i>
give him all those oats. And now we shall have
to send for the vet.”</p>

<p>“What’s the vet?” said Jack, looking still more
scared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>“The veterinary surgeon, the animals’ doctor,”
replied Robert. “You see, Master Jack, I told
you not to do it. This poor donkey has lived
very poorly all the winter, as any one can see
from his thinness and the state of his coat. Then
he got very hot in the donkey-race. He ought
to have had cool grass to eat and a <i>very</i> few oats,
but you gave him as much as he could eat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, poor Neddy, <i>poor</i> Neddy! He’ll die, and
it’s all my fault!” and poor little Jack burst out
crying.</p>

<p>“Come, Master Jack, he won’t die this time;
but we shall have to bleed him and then turn him
out to grass.”</p>

<p>Robert sent for the veterinary surgeon, and
told Jack to go away. Then he took a lancet,
and made a little hole with it in a vein in my
neck. It bled, and I began to feel better. My
head wasn’t so heavy, and I fetched my breath
more easily; I was able to get up. Robert then
stopped the bleeding, and in about an hour took
me out, and left me in a fresh cool meadow.</p>

<div class="caption">"Jack and Janie took the Greatest Care of me."</div>
</div>

<p>I was better, but not yet well, and it was a
whole week before I could do anything except
rest in the meadow and crop the grass. Jack
and Janie took the greatest care of me; they
came to see me several times a day. They
picked grass for me, so that I shouldn’t have to
stoop my head down to get it for myself. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
brought me cool juicy lettuce from the kitchen
garden, and cabbage-leaves, and carrots; and
every evening they came to see me home to my
stable, and there filled my manger for my supper
with what I liked best of all, potato-peel and salt.
Jack wanted to give me his pillow one night,
because he thought that my head was too low
when I was asleep; and Janie wanted to fetch
the counterpane off her bed to cover me up with,
and keep me warm. Another day they came
and put bits of cotton-wool round my feet, for
fear they should get cold. I was quite unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
at not knowing how to show them my gratitude
for such great kindness; but, unfortunately,
though I could understand all they said I was
unable to say anything myself.</p>

<p>At last I was well again, and with Janie and
Jack and some cousins of theirs who also came
to stay with their grandmamma, I passed a very
happy summer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the summer was nearly over, several of
the children’s fathers and mothers came to stay
at my mistress’s house, and the next day it was
arranged that the gentlemen were to go out
partridge shooting. Two of the bigger boys,
who were thirteen or fourteen, and whose names
were Teddy and Dick, were to be allowed to go
shooting with their fathers for the first time, and
a gentleman of the neighborhood, with his son
Norman, who was nearly fifteen, was also to join
the party.</p>

<p>The next morning Teddy and Dick were up
before anybody else, and marched proudly about
with their guns in their hands, and their game-bags
slung across their shoulders, talking of all
the game they were going to bring home.</p>

<p>“I say, Teddy,” said Dick, “when our game-bags
are quite full, where <i>shall</i> we put the rest of
the game we shall shoot?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_p45.jpg" width="500" height="683" alt="The Gentlemen and Boys formed a Broad Line across the
Field" />
<div class="caption">"The Gentlemen and Boys formed a Broad Line across the
Field” P. <a href="#Page_46">46.</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s just what <i>I</i> was wondering,” said
Teddy. “I know, we’ll put Neddy’s panniers
on, and take him with us.”</p>

<p>I didn’t like this at all, because I knew these
young sportsmen would fire at everything they
saw and would be quite as likely to shoot <i>me</i> as
they would a partridge. But there was no help
for it, and so when the party assembled at the
front door, I was there too, harnessed and ready.</p>

<p>“Bless me!” said Norman’s father, when, after
a mile or two, he joined us with his son, “what’s
that donkey for?”</p>

<p>“That’s to fetch home the young gentlemen’s
game, sir,” said the keeper, touching his hat, with
a grin.</p>

<p>The partridges rose in great numbers. I stayed
prudently at the rear. The gentlemen and the
boys formed a broad line across the field; shots
resounded all along the line; the dogs pricked
up their ears, watched to see where the game
fell, and fetched it in. I kept an eye on those
young boasters; I saw them shoot, and shoot,
and shoot again, but they never hit anything,
not even when the three of them aimed at the
same partridge at once, for it only flew all the
better. At the end of two hours the gentlemen’s
game-bags were full, and those of the boys still
empty.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said one of the gentlemen, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
passed me on the way to a neighboring farmhouse,
where they had left their dinner; “are
the panniers still empty? Ah, I suppose you
have stuffed <i>all</i> your game into your game-bags.
My dear boys, if you fill them so full, they’ll
burst!” and the gentleman looked at the other
sportsmen and laughed.</p>

<p>Dick, Teddy, and Norman got very red, but
they said nothing, and presently they were all
seated round a capital basket of provisions under
a tree,—a chicken-pie, ham, hard-boiled eggs,
cheese, and cake. The boys were ravenously
hungry, and ate enough to frighten the people
who passed by.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” said Norman’s father, “so you’ve
not been very lucky. Neddy doesn’t walk as if he
were over-burdened with the game you’ve shot.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Norman; “you see, father, we had
no dogs to fetch in the partridges we shot. <i>You</i>
had all the dogs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you <i>have</i> shot some, have you? Why
didn’t you go and fetch them in yourselves?”</p>

<p>“Well, father, we didn’t see them fall, and so
we didn’t know where they were.”</p>

<p>At this all the gentlemen, and even the keepers,
roared with laughter, and the boys reddened
angrily.</p>

<p>“Well, then, boys,” said Teddy’s father, “we
will stay here and rest for an hour, and you shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
go with one of the keepers and all our dogs, and
see if you have better luck this time in finding the
partridges you shoot, but can’t see fall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how jolly! Thanks, father. Come on,
Dick; come on, Norman; now we shall have our
bags as full as theirs.”</p>

<p>The gentlemen told the keeper to keep close
to the boys, and not let them do anything rash.
They started off with the dogs, and I followed
some way behind, as usual. The partridges rose
in numbers, as they did in the morning; the dogs
were on the watch, but they brought in no game,
because there was none to bring.</p>

<p>At last Norman grew impatient at having as
yet shot nothing, and seeing one of the dogs
stop and prick up her ears, he thought a partridge
must be just going to rise, and that it would be
much easier to shoot it while it was still on the
ground than when it was flying. So he took aim
and fired.</p>

<p>There was a yell of pain, the dog made a leap
into the air, and then rolled over quite dead.</p>

<p>“You stupid fellow!” shouted the keeper, as
he ran to the spot, “you’ve shot our very best
dog! Here’s a pretty end of your fine sport!”</p>

<p>Norman stood speechless from fright. Dick
and Teddy looked scared out of their wits. The
keeper restrained his anger, and stood looking at
the poor dog without saying another word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_p49.jpg" width="500" height="512" alt="A Sad Procession." />
<div class="caption">"A Sad Procession."</div>
</div>

<p>I went up to see who was the unfortunate
victim of Norman’s stupid recklessness. Judge
of my horror when I recognized my old friend
Jenny! I had known Jenny as a puppy, when
she lived at the dog fancier’s at the corner of the
market to which I used to carry vegetables in
bygone days. Poor old Jenny! she and I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
been such friends! To think she should have
come to this! That wretched, conceited boy!</p>

<p>We turned back towards the farm, a sad procession.
The keeper put Jenny’s body into one
of my panniers, and walked along by my side;
the boys followed, with hanging heads and downcast
looks.</p>

<p>The sportsmen were still sitting under the
tree, and were surprised when they saw us coming.
Seeing that something was wrong, and that
one of my panniers was hanging heavily down,
they got up and came quickly towards us. The
boys hung back; the keeper went forward.</p>

<p>“What have they shot?” asked one of the
gentlemen. “Is it a sheep or a calf?”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing to laugh at, sir,” replied the
keeper; “it’s our very best dog, Jenny. That
young gentleman shot her, thinking she was a
partridge.”</p>

<p>“Jenny! Well! Catch me taking boys out
shooting again!”</p>

<p>“Come here, Norman,” said his father. “Just
see to what a pass your conceit has brought you!
Say good-by to your friends, sir, and go straight
home at once! You will put your gun in my
room, and you will not lay a finger on it again
till you have learned to have a more modest
opinion of yourself!”</p>

<p>“But, father,” said Norman, trying to look as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
if he did not care, “everybody knows that all
great sportsmen sometimes shoot their dogs by
mistake!”</p>

<p>His father looked at him for a moment, and
then, turning to the others with an air of disgust,
he said:—</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I really must apologize to you for
having ventured to bring with me to-day a boy
who has so little sense of decent behavior. I
never imagined he was capable of such silly impertinence.”
He then turned towards his son,
and said severely:—</p>

<p>“You have heard my order, sir. Go at once!”
Norman hung his head and departed in confusion.</p>

<p>“You see, boys,” said Teddy’s father, “what
comes of conceit, of thinking you are so much
more clever than you really are. This might
have happened to either of you. You were so
very sure that nothing was easier than shooting,
and this is the result. It is quite clear that you
are too young to be allowed to go shooting, so
you can go back to your gardens and your
childish games, and it will be better for all
concerned.”</p>

<p>Dick and Teddy hung their heads without a
word. The party turned sadly homewards, and,
after tea, the boys buried my poor friend in the
garden.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> days after this there was a fair in the
next village, and my mistress’s grandchildren
were to be taken there by their fathers and
mothers. There were fifteen of them altogether,
or sixteen including myself, for little Jack and
his cousin Harry rode on my back, and the rest
walked or drove.</p>

<p>When we got to the fair we heard some people
talking about a wonderful performing donkey
who was said to be very clever, and who would
begin his tricks in ten minutes at the other
end of the meadow where the fair was being
held.</p>

<p>“Oh, father, we <i>must</i> go and see him,” said
Teddy. “Please, may we?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my boy; we ought to see this performing
donkey, though, for my part, I don’t
believe he could beat Neddy, there, for intelligence
and sagacity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>I was much pleased to hear the gentleman’s
good opinion of me, and I headed the little procession
to the other end of the field. Jack’s
mother lifted him and Harry off my back and
stood them upon a bench, close to the path that
was left open for people to come into the enclosure,
which was surrounded with seats. I
stood outside, just behind my two little friends.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the showman appeared, leading
in the donkey that was supposed to be so
clever. He was a poor dismal-looking creature,
who looked as if he wanted a good meal.</p>

<p>“Jack,” said little Harry to his cousin, loud
enough for me to hear, “I don’t think <i>that</i>
donkey looks very clever. I’m sure he’s not
nearly so clever as our dear old Neddy.”</p>

<p>I agreed with him, and was very much pleased
to hear what Harry said; so I thought to myself,
“I’ll let them all know it before long, or my
name’s not Neddy.” I left the place where I had
been standing, and took my position near the
entrance.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” began the showman,
“I have the honor to introduce to you Mr. Muffles,
the wonderful performing ass. This ass, ladies
and gentlemen, is not such an ass as he looks.
He knows a great deal, a great deal more than
some of you. He is an ass without an equal.
Come, Muffles, show the company what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
can do. Make your bow, and let these ladies and
gentlemen see that you have learned manners.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_p54.jpg" width="500" height="556" alt="Muffles took the Bunch of Flowers." />
<div class="caption">"Muffles took the Bunch of Flowers."</div>
</div>

<p>The donkey went forward two of three steps,
and bent his head in a most melancholy fashion.
I was indignant with the showman; I thought
to myself, “It’s quite easy to see that this poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Muffles has been taught his tricks by means of
a rope’s end;” and I made up my mind to be
revenged on that man before the performance
was over.</p>

<p>“Now, Muffles, take this nosegay, and give it
to the prettiest lady here.”</p>

<p>Muffles took the bunch of flowers in his teeth,
walked sadly all round the ring, and at last went
and dropped the nosegay into the lap of a very
ugly, fat woman. She was close to me, and I could
see that she had a piece of sugar concealed in her
hand. “What a fraud!” I thought. “Of course,
she’s the showman’s wife.” I was so disgusted
with what looked like the donkey’s bad taste that,
before any one could stop me, I leaped clear into
the ring, seized the nosegay in my teeth, and
trotted round and laid it at the feet of little Janie.</p>

<p>The crowd all clapped vigorously. They wondered
who I was. “<i>So</i> intelligent!” they said
to each other. Muffles’s master, however, did not
seem pleased. As for Muffles himself, he took
no notice whatever. I began to think he must
really be rather a stupid animal, and that isn’t
common with us donkeys.</p>

<p>When the audience was quiet again, the showman
said:—</p>

<p>“Now, Muffles, you’ve shown us the prettiest
lady here. Now go and point out the silliest
person present,” and so saying he gave him a big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
dunce-cap made of colored paper and adorned
with rosettes.</p>

<p>Muffles took it in his teeth, and going straight
to a heavy-looking fat boy, with a face exactly
like that of a pig, put it on his head. The fat
boy was so like the fat woman that it was quite
easy to see he must be the showman’s son, and
of course in the trick.</p>

<p>“Good!” said I to myself, “my time has
come!”</p>

<p>Before they could think of stopping me, I
had taken the cap off the boy’s head, and was
chasing the showman himself round and round
the ring. The crowd roared with laughter, and
clapped till they were tired. All at once the
showman tripped, and went down on one knee;
I profited by this to put the cap firmly on his
head, and to ram it down till it covered his chin.</p>

<p>The showman shouted, and danced about trying
to tear the cap off, and I stood on my hind
legs and capered about just as he did until the
crowd nearly died from laughing. “Well done,
donkey! Bravo, donkey! It’s you that’s the
real performing donkey!” they shouted.</p>

<p>There was no doing anything more after this.
Hundreds of people crowded into the ring, and
were so anxious to caress me that I was afraid
they would tear me to pieces. The people from
our own village, who knew me, were more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
proud of me, and before very long all the people
in the place were telling wonderful tales of my
intelligence and my adventures.</p>

<p>They said I had once been at a fire, and
worked a fire-engine all by myself; that I had
gone up a ladder to the third story, opened my
mistress’s door, awakened her, picked her up, and
jumped off the roof with her in safety to the ground.
They said that another time I had, all alone, slain
fifty robbers, strangling them so cleverly one after
the other with my teeth when they were asleep,
that not one had time to wake up and give the
alarm to the others; that I had then gone into
the caves where the robbers lived, and had set
free a hundred and fifty prisoners whom the
robbers had captured. At another time, they
said, I had beaten in a race all the swiftest horses
in the country, and had run seventy-five miles in
five hours without stopping.</p>

<p>The crowd grew thicker and thicker to hear
these wonderful tales, until the crush was so great
that some of the people could hardly breathe,
and the police had to come to the rescue. It
was with the greatest difficulty, even with the
help of the policemen, that I was able to get
away, and I was obliged to pretend both to bite
and to kick in order to clear a path; but of
course I didn’t hurt anybody.</p>

<p>At last I got free from the crowd and into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
road. I looked about for Jack and Harry and
the others, but they were nowhere to be seen;
for as soon as the crowding became dangerous,
their parents had hurried them away. Losing
no time, I took the road home. Before I had
gone a mile I overtook them, fifteen people
packed into the two carriages; and by tea-time
we all reached home safe and sound, everybody
delighted with my remarkable sagacity.</p>

<p>But after it was all over, I began to think of
the unfortunate showman, and I felt very, very
sorry for the unkind trick I had played him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I never</span> could like that boy Norman; I thought
him both cowardly and conceited. I could not
forget that he had killed my friend, the poor
dog, Jenny. One day, when he came to my
mistress’s house on a visit, he insisted on riding
on my back. “Now,” thought I to myself, “I’ll
have my revenge.”</p>

<p>Just beyond the garden there was a wood,
and beyond the wood there was a very deep and
dirty ditch, generally full to the brim with mud.
Norman had been boasting what an excellent
rider he was, and invited the others to come
with him through the wood to see him jump the
ditch. They all came, though they did not believe
he could do it.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they started, Norman on my
back, and the others running by my side along
the path through the wood, when I threw up my
heels and dashed aside from the path into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
bushes. “All right,” shouted Norman, “you run
on by the path as far as the ditch, and see
whether I don’t jump it before you get there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will?” I said to myself. I went
quietly along for a little way, where the
bushes were thin and fairly far apart, and then,
without any warning, I plunged right into a
thicket of brambles. <i>My</i> skin is tough, so I
didn’t mind them, but Norman’s face and hands
and stockinged legs were scratched, and the
thorns stuck into his clothes from head to foot.
He was a nice object by the time we got to the
ditch: he had quite given up his boastful idea of
jumping over it, and did all he could to make
me stop and let him get off my back.</p>

<p>“Not if I know it,” thought I. “I shall never
get such a chance again of punishing you for
shooting Jenny;” so I galloped along the edge of
the ditch, and when I had reached a very steep
and slippery place, I suddenly stopped short, and
jerked Norman off my back. He was unable to
gain his footing, and pitched headlong into the
thick, black mud.</p>

<p>Just then the other children came racing down
the path; but what was their surprise and alarm
to find me looking into the ditch, and Norman
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>“Norman! Norman!” they shouted, “where
are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_p61.jpg" width="500" height="639" alt="Along from the Edge of the Ditch." />
<div class="caption">"Along from the Edge of the Ditch."</div>
</div>

<p>“Here—oh, help!” said a half-stifled voice
at last. They looked into the ditch, and there
was Norman, half drowned in mud; he was on
his feet again, and was standing on the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
of the ditch; but it was nearly five feet deep, and
the mud was up to his neck. “Help me out!
oh, help me out! I shall be drowned!”</p>

<p>Norman’s screams attracted the attention of
two farm-hands who were passing near at hand,
and they ran up to see what was the matter. In
a few minutes they had got a long pole and
had let one end down into the ditch so that
Norman could catch hold of it. Then the men
pulled slowly at the other end of the pole, and
at last Norman managed to scramble out. He
was covered with mud, and his teeth were chattering
with cold and fright. I began to be sorry
for what I had done, and kept behind the children,
who were hurrying Norman home as fast
as he could go.</p>

<p>I heard the next day that Norman was very
ill; he was obliged to stay in bed. The doctor
was afraid he was going to have a bad fever, and
be ill a long while. He shook his head when
the children went to inquire after Norman, and
advised my mistress not to let the children ride
me at present, until Norman was better, and
could tell them how the accident had happened.</p>

<p>I knew it was not an accident, and began to
be much afraid in consequence of what I had
done. When Norman got well enough to tell
them all about it, and how badly I had behaved,
they all looked at me very seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, when Robert, the stableman,
came as usual to fetch me to be saddled,
and to take Jack and Janie for a ride, he said
nothing to me, but, to my great alarm, groomed
and saddled the other donkey that lived in the
stable. In a few minutes Jack came in at the
door, his face very sad, and his eyes full of tears.</p>

<p>“Neddy,” he said, “I’m very, very sorry, but
grandma won’t let me ride you any more. She’s
afraid you’ll be naughty again, and kick me off,
as you did poor Norman. Oh, Neddy dear, how
could you do it?”</p>

<p>I was dreadfully upset by this, and wanted to
explain to Jack that it was because I hated Norman,
and that I shouldn’t think of doing it to
him, or Janie, or anybody else whom I loved,
and who was kind to me. But I didn’t know
how to say this to Jack, so I only drooped my
head, and touched his shoulder with my nose.</p>

<p>“Mind, Master Jack,” said Robert, “don’t let
that vicious donkey touch you. Perhaps he’ll bite
you. Come away, my lad, directly,” and Robert
seized Jack by the hand, and pulled him away.</p>

<p>“Yes, the horrid brute!” said Teddy, who,
with the others, had come to the stable door.
“Of course, Norman isn’t always nice, but Neddy
had no business to try to drown him. I’ll take
good care that I have nothing more to do with
such a donkey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>“And I, too,” said Dick, and so said all the
others. Jack looked very sorrowful, but as
Robert put him on the other donkey’s back and
led him away he looked round and said to me in
his usual kind little voice:—</p>

<p>“Poor, poor Neddy! Never mind, I’ll always
love you just the same, though I mustn’t ride you
any more, and perhaps some day you’ll be good
again, won’t you, dear Neddy?”</p>

<p>I could have cried when I heard this. It was
more than I could bear. As soon as Jack was
gone, I crept out of the stable, and made my way
into the fields. Then I lay down and thought of
all the wicked things I had done in my life: how
I had knocked my first mistress down, and broken
her nose; how I had deceived the farmer, and
how revengeful and evil I had been when he
punished me for my deceit. I thought of all the
happy life I had led in my present home, and how
very, very kind they had all been to me until I
had done this wicked thing to Norman. Norman
had killed poor Jenny, it is true; but then
he didn’t do it on purpose, and his father had
punished him for it; what business had <i>I</i> to give
way to feelings of revenge? I thought of dear
little Janie and Jack, and how good and kind
they had been to me when I was ill; and when I
remembered that, owing to my wickedness, they
were not to be allowed to ride me any more, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
felt so unhappy that I could not keep still any
longer. I began to run as hard as I could, trying
to run away from myself, but the faster I ran, the
more miserable I was, until at last I ran my head
right up against a stone wall, and fell down
senseless.</p>

<p>When I came to myself it was late in the afternoon,
and I couldn’t tell where I was. Three
people were sitting a little way off by the roadside,
but as their backs were turned they didn’t
see me. What was my astonishment to recognize
in them the owner of the performing donkey
Muffles, with his wife and son! They looked
unhappy and hungry, and I learned from what
they said that poor Muffles had been badly hurt
by the crowd that day at the fair, and that they
had been obliged to leave him for a time with a
kind farmer who offered to turn him out to grass
in his field, while they went about looking for a
little work to keep them alive until Muffles was
once more well enough to perform at fairs.</p>

<p>When I heard all this, I felt still more unhappy,
for it was all <i>my</i> fault that Muffles had been hurt,
and the showman’s family forced to go hungry
because they had no money to buy food. Then
I suddenly remembered that little Jack hoped I
would some day turn good again. “I can begin
to be good again this very minute,” thought I.
“I can follow these people to the next village,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
and earn some money for them by performing
tricks.” So I jumped up, and trotted behind
them until they stopped at the door of a little
inn to ask the host if he would let them stay
there that night. They said they had no money
to pay for a night’s lodging, but perhaps he could
give them some work to do instead. The host
shook his head, and said that he had plenty of
people in his house to do all his work, and that
the showman must go somewhere else.</p>

<p>Just as they were turning sorrowfully away
from the door, I trotted up, bowed to the innkeeper,
and then stood up on my hind legs and
began to dance. I did several of the tricks that
Muffles was accustomed to do, and I did them so
gracefully that quite a large crowd collected. At
last I thought it was time to make the collection,
so I picked up the showman’s hat in my teeth
and took it round to everybody in the crowd.
Before I had finished my round the hat was so
full of money that I had to empty it into the
showman’s hands, and when he came to count his
gains there proved to be nearly ten dollars. So
the showman and his wife and boy were able to
have a good supper and a night’s lodging at the
inn, and they gave me a supper and a night’s
lodging in the stable.</p>

<p>In the morning I followed them to the next
place, and we gave two or three performances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
in different parts of the town; so that before
dinner-time I had earned for the showman no
less than sixteen dollars, and then I thought I had
atoned for my unkindness to him on the day of
the fair, and that I would go back and try to
show Jack that I was now good.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_p67.jpg" width="500" height="509" alt="I took the Hat in my Teeth." />
<div class="caption">“<span class="smcap">“I took the Hat in my Teeth.”</span>”</div>
</div>

<p>I soon found the right road, and reached the
house in the afternoon when everything was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
quiet, and all the people indoors at tea. Just as
I came up to the high wall of the kitchen garden,
on my way to the stable, I saw a tramp trying to
climb over it, doubtless intending to steal things
out of the garden. I made a jump, caught the
tramp’s foot in my mouth, and pulled him down.
He called out for help, but in another moment
he fell, hitting his head, and lay still. At this
moment another tramp came running up; I gave
him a kick as he passed me, and stretched him
flat by his friend. The second tramp howled
so loudly that all the servants came running
out of the house to see what was the matter.
I was still standing over the tramps, ready to
kick them if they offered to get up. When they
were questioned, their replies were so suspicious
that they were taken into the house, and the
police sent for.</p>

<p>So I had saved my good mistress’s garden,
and perhaps several other people’s houses, from
being robbed. They were all so pleased with
my intelligence that they said I should be forgiven
for my past wickedness, and that the bigger
boys should ride me for a time; and if they
found me always gentle and quiet, then perhaps
they would let Janie and Jack ride me as
before.</p>

<p>To crown all, I heard in a few days that Norman
was nearly well again, and that he bore me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
no ill-will, for he said I must have seen something
or other in the path, perhaps a toad, or a
piece of paper, that frightened me and made me
run away. How dreadfully ashamed of myself
I felt when I heard this! After all, Norman
seemed a much better and more generous boy
than I had at first imagined him to be. At any
rate, <i>he</i> was not revengeful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> that day onward I lived a very happy life.
My kind old mistress said that I should never
be sent away; that I should never want for anything,
but should remain with the family as long
as I lived, and that they would do all in their
power to take care of me. Jack had loved me
even when I was wicked and miserable, so I was
always looked upon as Jack’s donkey, even when
Jack was at home in London. He always paid
his grandmamma a long visit every summer,
until he was ten years old, and then he went
away with Janie and his father and mother to
Australia. After that I was considered to be
Harry’s donkey, because Harry, of all her grandchildren,
paid the most frequent visits to his
grandmamma. Harry is not so good as Jack
was, but he is a kind boy; he never treats me
roughly, he always takes great care of me, and
calls me his dear old Neddy.</p>

<p>A series of talks between Harry and his cousins
made me think of writing my memoirs. Harry
always said that I did not understand what I did,
nor why I did it. His cousins and Jack admitted
my intelligence and my desire to do good. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
profited by a severe winter which did not permit
my being much out of doors, to compose and
write this account of some of the important
events of my life. Perhaps they may amuse you,
my young friends, and in any case they will make
you understand that if you wish to be well served,
you must treat your servants well; that those you
fancy the most stupid are not always so stupid as
they appear; that a donkey, as well as others, has
a heart to love his masters and to suffer from bad
treatment; a will to revenge himself or to show
his affection; that he can, thanks to his masters,
be happy or unhappy, be a friend or an enemy,
poor donkey though he be. I live happily; I
am loved by everybody, cared for like a friend by
my little master Harry. I begin to grow old, but
donkeys live long, and as long as I can walk and
stand up, I will hold my strength and my intelligence
at the service of my master.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
